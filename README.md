### Development

To ease development we use [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) to compile JS with browserify/watchify, compile sass to css, optimize images, etc:

First, install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

To kick off the development server and all pre-requisite tasks:

`npm start`

To build a production ready version of the app use:

`npm run build`

To publish a production ready demo to GitHub Pages:

`npm run publish:demo`

To visualize packages contributing to bundle file size:

`npm run inspect:bundle`

Run the tests!

`npm test`
